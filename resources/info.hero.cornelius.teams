Corn can be a situational add to most teams. However he is most often used with some combination of Cleaver, Maya, Celeste, Peppy, Jorgen, Jhu, Nebula, Martha/Thea as an anti-mage team. Or, he is also used in teams where you expect the common counter would be Corn. For example you might use Corn in an Orion team to guard against Satori, but just be aware that this type of counter picking in defense can weaken your team in another area.
