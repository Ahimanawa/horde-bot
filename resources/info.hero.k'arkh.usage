The days of K’arkh ruling the META may be over, but he is still one of the strongest damage dealers in the game and a force to be reckoned with at almost all levels. Considered by many to be a necessary evil in most player tool kits, he can be quite fun to use and build a team around.

K’arkh is still arguably the most powerful warriors in the game and is one of the least resource intensive damage dealers. His high armor penetration, massive damage output, and ability to recover health make him very formidable. All of his skills synergize very well with each other making him the only damage dealer you usually need on his team.

K’arkh specializes in killing off low health back and midline heroes with heavy burst damage. Most backline heroes do not have the armor to reduce K’arkh’s Deadly Tendrils damage. Artifact armor buffs from a hero can greatly reduce the damage if it is greater than K’arkh’s armor penetration. With 2 kills on an ult K’arkh can have enough energy to quickly trigger his ult again, quickly chaining theem together to kill the entire enemy team.

K’arkh is fairly low health and very vulnerable to Magic Damage because Negator of Laws skill only blocks physical damage. He is hard countered by Andvari in most cases as Nexus of Horror targets the 3 lowest health heroes who are usually behind Andvari who’s Living Earth skill protects heroes from being Knocked Up/Lifted. K’arkh can also be countered by Blind (from heroes like Fox, Artemis, or Peppy) as all physical attacks will miss.
