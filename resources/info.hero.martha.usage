Martha, the pinnacle of healers and one of the rarest Heroes to get to 6 stars. She is an amazing healer who doesn't require any ultimate ability to heal. Her skills let her heal over time and at a reasonable rate to the whole team.  Also one of her greatest assets is the ability to speed up the team for 6 seconds, giving you an energy boost with attacks during that time.

Martha fits into almost any team and her counters are rear line attacks, i.e. Luther, Cleaver, Keira that deal area of effect damage or Celeste who can block some of Martha's healing. During her skill of releasing the teapot which gives health. When facing Martha, ensure you have a specific set of heroes to combat her healing. If using Jhu to fight Martha, he needs boosted by nebula and if using Jorgen to combat Martha ensure large amounts of physical damage so the leper skill can work the best. A good example is Galahad, Ginger, Jorgen and Jet where Martha is directly targeted (Jorgen leper) and her haeling is disrupted by AOE (Galahad and Ginger).

She is best paired with heroes who benefit most from her healing to stall out teams, Ziri and Lilith examples; or with heroes who need the speed boost for offense, Keira, Karkh, Twins, for example.
