Mojo is currently one of the more specialty heroes in the game. His 4th skill Hex is his main usefulneeses, this skill provides magic damage at a 60% rate of all damage received by the target in the last 2 seconds and repeats until Mojo's death. It is useful for Brog in Outland, campaign bosses, or special event bosses throughout the year. However it is too random (1 in 5) to be as useful during war or arena battles. If this hex lands on the tank, perfect! However if it lands on Lian, essentially Mojo is asleep the whole match. The rest of his abilities are really lacking a punch for Mojo to be considered over other available heroes.

Mojo has the 5th best Magic attack in the game (as of 12/6/20), so to capitalize on this he needs to be supported by magic penetration and magic attack buffs. Faceless and Orion make great allies to add magic penetration, with Faceless being able to copy Mojo'’'s missiles.
 
Now for the drawbacks, Mojo has one of the worst armors in the game and sits in a relatively close position. He is easily defeated by physical damage. Making him an easy target for Keira or K’arkh.
