Maya is a mid field healer/slow damage dealer. She is used more as support for other heroes or with Nebula to boost her poison damage. She is not a very common hero to deal with in an arena or war due to her having such a unique skill-set, which is her ability to group enemies for other damage dealers. This ability assists other heroes, Heidi, Ziri, Nebula, Luther, Arachne, Cleaver, Aurora and Daredevil to name a few. Having the enemies in a group allows other heroes the ability to maximize multi target or AoE damage with their perspective skills.

As far as her damage dealing properties goes, her skills are all based on her magic attack; with Maya currently having the 2nd highest magic attack of all the heroes. The one major problem with her damage dealing is that it's over time, 5 or 8 seconds; the benefit is that the damage is to all 5 heroes. Meaning, the healer(s) on the other team must be able to heal all heroes fast (Martha). If you pair Maya with Nebula her healing and damage will increase immensely, however it is still too slow which means you need to slow down the enemy team. How do you do this? Arachne, Luther, Faceless, Ishmael, Ziri; using heroes that stun to allow the poison magic damage to truly work its effects.

Maya lacks armor making her an easy physical attack target, she should be at or near the 3rd position and if paired with a Magic Penetration and or a Magic Attack Artifact boost, her poison will do considerably more damage.
