Thea, the first healer you get in the game, who quickly is replaced by Celeste or Martha. But wait there’s more to Thea than you know. Her benefits are being a half healer/half support. Thea's third and fourth skills are her support skills, the third mildly damages all opponents and silences all magic attacks for 3 seconds, this comes in real handy against the twins, or Aurora/Peppy teams. Her fourth skill is more complex, If a hero’s health drops below 30%, their skills increase in Speed by up to 50%. Now we have to see who this helps the most and least.

You should try to avoid heroes that have passive skills, i.e. Astaroth, Ishmael, Luther, Keira, Karkh, to name a few as these will not benefit from the speed boost. Try to focus on heroes that: 1) will be below 30% health, and 2) Have 3 non-passive skills such as Elmir, and Jhu. Thea helps twins teams as she benefits from the magic attack artifact buffs and her skills of silence will work on other twins teams, as well as increasing Krista’s or Lars’s skills if they fall below 30% health. With this you can start building a base and capitalizing on Thea's Silence against mage teams.

She has some of the strongest defense stats in the game, so she can be a strong backline hero to stand up to Jhu, Jorgen, and Luther.
