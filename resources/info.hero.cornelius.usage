Cornelius is mostly used as a situational counter to mage teams. Cornelius can be effective even at lower levels but really shines with more investment. Cornelius is unique in the game in that he is the only hero whose main attack is physical but where the damage is based on his magic attack. Similarly the damage of Cornelius ult is based on magic attack but deals physical damage. This is an important fact to bear in mind when choosing which heroes to pair with Cornelius, heroes that boost magic attack will improve his damage output, but so do heroes with weapons that boost armor penetration (not magic penetration), and critical hit chance.

Cornelius skills to boost the magic defense of the team, lower magic attack of enemy with highest magic attack, along with his artifact weapon boosting magic defense makes him an obvious counter to mages. But in addition to this his ult targeting the enemy with the highest intelligence and dealing damage proportional to their intelligence is what makes him a great counter pick. Cornelius is capable of taking out Satori, Lars, Orion, Celeste, Peppy in a single hit depending what boosts are in play. If he is himself boosted he can also one shot additional heroes. You still have to consider the rest of your team, Cornelius is not a hard counter to mage on his own but he can be an effective add against any mage teams.

If you are facing Cornelius with a mage team, you need to consider which hero in your team has the highest intelligence and is capable of taking the hit. For example, the primary reason for the guidance to keep Krista intelligence ahead of Lars is so that she would receive the hit and absorb it with her ice shield. In this way she can protect lars. Similarly adding high intelligence and armor mages such as Thea can help shield your mage DPS. A way to counter Krista's protection is to pair Cornelius with Satori; Satori steals intelligence with each of his main attacks so using this you can decrease Krista intelligence below Lars so that Lars become subject of Corn's ult.
