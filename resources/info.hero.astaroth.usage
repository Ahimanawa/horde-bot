Astaroth is widely regarded as one of the best tanks in the game. Astaroth's main strengths lie in his very high armor and magic defense along with his damage share, and resurrect skills but also his versatility - he works as a tank in nearly all teams. He does a negligible amount of damage but in many ways offers the greatest team protection of any tank. His ability to resurrect fallen heroes can make him ideal for teams with squishy heroes that need another shot at life such as Keira, Karkh, Lars, Orion, Elmir etc. It is often overlooked but his skill that burns the energy of the furthest enemy is also useful when the damage dealer is in the last spot, for example a twins team with Lars in the last position.

Astaroth is listed as an off-tank but once you have leveled his armor and health he is one of the sturdiest tanks in the game. However given that he is listed as an off-tank this means his positioning is such that he stands close to whoever is in the #2 spot than most other tanks. Sometimes this problematic in the case of using Astaroth with Andvari against K'arkh, as it means that Andvari will still receive splash damage from K'arkh's auto attack. However in other cases this same trait is beneficial, for example Astaroth is often the preferred tank in K'arkh teams for all the reasons listed above (damage share/resurrect) but also because his positioning allow K'arkh to receive damage and therefore gain energy/ult earlier.
