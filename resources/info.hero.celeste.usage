Celeste is a hero you want to level, no question. She is incredibly useful in so many different builds and as a counter hero in many different situations. She is a hybrid hero in the sense that she is both a healer and has decent damage output, whereas most hybrid heroes suffer from being a jack-of-all trades master of none, Celeste manages to shine at both. Celeste has a few main uses: 1) Good single point healing (though lacks on overall team healing compared to Martha/Thea), 2) Clearing negative status effects such as fox-marks, 3) good single point magic damage with her main attack, 4) blocking healing effects on enemy team whilst in dark form, blocked healing being converted to damage, 4) boosting team magic attack with her artifact weapon.

Given her strengths it's not hard to see why Celeste is often indispensable but to list some situations where she excels: Celeste is good at countering enemy healers, especially when they have paired Dorian next to a high-DPS unit as it can convert their healing to damage and kill them; her blocked blocked healing can help overcome the team healing of Martha/Thea so you can kill heroes where you would not otherwise; her cursed flames not only block healing in the typical sense but also resurrects from Astaroth; her removing status effects from the team helps against twins (water marks) but particularly against Satori fox marks, by clearing fox marks she greatly decreases the damage of his ult on that ally; Celeste ult becomes available at half energy so she provides a near permanent magic attack boost to the team and can quickly stack magic attack boosts in the case that she takes damage which improves the teams damage output in the case that she's paired with other mages.
