Faceless is definitely one of the best support heroes in the game. He pretty much fits in any team combination and instantly makes the team trickier to defeat.
His second skill (Power throw) makes him an integral part of many META builds for different heroes or combination of heroes. For example, when added to K'arkh teams, his power throw helps K'arkh make quick work of the enemy tank. When added to Cleaver Peppy teams, his power throw syncs up with Cleaver + Peppy shields (Boldness + Putrefaction) and the enemy team's position 2 hero (in most cases the enemy's main DPS) take a ton of damage possibly killing that hero. His power throw skill alone makes him a monster support but he also has other attributes and skills that make him even more dangerous. His ult (first skill) allows him to transform into the last hero that used their ult and use that skill himself. Now imagine a K'arkh ult immediately followed by a Faceless ult. 
This is one of the reasons why the K'arkh META was so dangerous to go up against. In war attacks, players have the option of manually using skills such that a faceless ult can be immediately followed by a high damage dealing ult i.e. K'arkh, or a super CC ult i.e. Arachne to give your team a big advantage in battle.
His ultimate also activates his artifact bonus of Magic Penetration which makes it possible to pair him with heroes such as Satori, Arachne, Helios, etc. Also, he has a passive skill that increases the team magic defense by 3000 (when max skill level) which is useful when going up against a team of mages. 

When to use him on attack:
1. Use him with cleaver peppy vs teams that have Krista in position 2 in the enemy team. Example Cleaver Peppy Jorgen Faceless Martha vs Asta Krista Celeste Lars Dorian.
2. Use him with Satori when facing a tanky team to give Satori the Magic Pen buff to kill enemy team quickly.
3. Pair him with K'arkh vs non Andvari defense teams to destroy enemy defense team.
