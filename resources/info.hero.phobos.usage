Phobos, like Mojo, is currently one of the more speciality heroes in the game. His ultimate is the best thing about him. This skill paralyzes and drains the energy from an enemy for 6.6 seconds. However it is random so 1 in 5 chance of applying to the hereo you would prefer in wars/arena. This skill is completely negated by Sebastian’s shield. However this comes in really useful for campaign bosses, or special event bosses throughout the year. While paralyzed the enemy is unable to move, do skills, or attack. If this lands on a weak magic defense hero, it is possible to kill in 1 shot.

Phobos has the 12th best Magic attack in the game (as of 12/6/20), so to capitalize on this we need some Magic Penetration and some Magic Attack buffs. Faceless, Celeste and Orion make great allies with Faceless being able to copy Phobos' skill with a leveel buff and faceless magic attack will almost definitely kill a weak magic defense target in 1 shot, along with Celeste, or the twins.
 
Now for the drawbacks, Phobos is in the bottom third of armor defenses in the game. He is easily defeated by physical damage. Making him an easy target of Keira or K’arkh, Jhu, Jorgen, Luther, Cleaver.
