Orion is one of the best magic based damage dealers in the game, with a Nebula boost he can do an insane amount of damage. Because Orion gains energy from every attack he will ult regularly and can blast away teams, this also makes him useful to pair with other mages where his near ever-present artifact weapon boost will buff their magic penetration. This ability also comes with downsides though, because Orion gains bonus energy if he is against Satori he will stack a lot of fox marks on Orion which usually results in him dying to the first time Satori ults. Also, because Orion's ult will target the 3 highest health heroes he can bee countered by ensuring that these heroes are able to absorb the damage and having enough healing to survive long enough to kill Orion before he gets to your lower health DPS. Having Jorgen as one of these high-health heroes will cause him to ult early energy locking Orion and buying your team more time.

Orion pairs well with Nebula as stated but also with other mages especially those that are lackng in their own magic penetration such as Helios or Arachne. Because Orion is quite low health with high damage output he benefits greatly from being next to Dorian to have access to a lot of healing in a similar way that Keira-Dorian are also a good pairing.
