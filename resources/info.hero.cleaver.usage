Cleaver is one of the strongest tanks in the game as he has amongst the highest armor and health. If you're lucky enough to pull him from the heroic chest early in the game he's also probably your first 6* hero. If you don't you might feel like the fates hate you, that it's all a big conspiracy and 'only devs get Cleaver' ;) But assuming you were lucky enough to pull Cleaver or find yourself against an enemy Cleaver then there are some important things to know about what makes him so useful.

Cleaver is listed as tank/control, the control aspect comes in from Cleaver's ult where he can pull a backline hero to the front. This is useful for dealing with both front and backline hitters to either take out the person you pulled quickly (say to take out an enemy Martha), or to expose the backline to Jhu or Jorgen's redirected physical damage. To counter Cleaver's pull you can use Andvari (who stops the pull entirely), or place heroes at the back you don't mind being pulled, e.g. you can place Dorian at the back if it would be beneficial to have him pulled to the front and provide more healing to your front line. Jorgen can also be used to delay/stop Cleaver's ult due to his energy steal in the same way that he can shut down Galahad/Luther's ults. One thing to note is that Cleaver's hook is capable of knocking over Martha's totem so even in the case that you are blocking the pull with Andvari he can be useful for countering Martha by interfering with some of the healing that she would provide.

There is a strong synergy between Cleaver and Peppy, Peppy has a skill 'boldness' that casts a shield on an ally and damages nearby enemies when the ally takes damage. Cleaver has a skill 'putrefaction' that causes him to deal damage to himself over time. When these two are activated simultaneously it causes Peppy to deal high amounts of magic damage to nearby enemies for the duration.
