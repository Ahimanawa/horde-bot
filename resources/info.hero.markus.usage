Markus is a very underrated Tank, especially following his skill buffs in March 2020. Markus peaks late in the game, initially his skillset and ability to tank pales in comparison to other tanks you would have available (Astaroth, Galahad, Aurora) but as you progress Markus turns has one of the best total defense stats in the game, with a balance of the 5th best Armor and 6th best Magic Defense. With Nebula boost Markus also provides some of the highest healing in the gamee. He can be used as a solo tank, with his ultimate providing himself 5 seconds of invincibility or he can be used as an off tank particularly behind tanks such as Ziri or Luther that will leave their position uring battle. Even after defeating Markus his ghost will live on for 42 seconds of battle continuing to heal your heroes and hurt your enemies. Because Markus hangs around postmortem, a tactic for dealing with Markus is to work back to front eliminating the heroes in reverse order.  Jhu, Jorgen, Cleaver, Keira, and Kâ€™arkh all make worthy counters to Markus.

Not many players have Markus leveled at this time, so for new players it could be a challenge in how to deal with him compared to more commonly used heroes. Markus is strongest against mage teams due to his magic defeense artifact weapon and in situations where you need quick healing and protection for your tank.
