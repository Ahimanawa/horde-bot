Dark Star is not a hero you would build a team around, she is rarely seen as a must-have hero, but she can be a solid addition to a lot of teams. She is not a primary DPS and works best when paired with other physical DPS. Darkstar works well with other heroes that add dodge boost to the team such as Aurora, her skills make her useful against front-line damage dealers, where she can slow enemies and even turn them to fight on your side. She also has her uses against backline damage dealers where you are trying to turn the tide by gaining time in-battle because of how her ult stuns the back row. For example this can make Dark Star a good counterpick against say Dare Devil who is looking to ramp up on damage quickly, Dark Star can stun her and buy your team time to break through.

Darkstar is a good pick with Daredevil teams, Daredevil has a skill that causes her to get a bonus attack every time a hero attacks from behind her. Darkstar has a skill that causes a shadow version to attack every time she does, both of these attacks trigger Daredevil so she gains x2 bonus attacks every time Dark Star attacks.
