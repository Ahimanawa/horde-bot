Especially since her rework Daredevil has become viable as a main DPS. Her strengths lie in that she has high critical hit chance and her physical attack can ramp up with each critical hit with no limit that allows her to deal an increasing level of damage as the battle continues. Daredevil also gains bonus attacks whenever someone attack from behind her, for this reason she pairs well with all back line marksman such as Elmir, Daredevil, Ginger, Darkstar, Artemis, Fox etc, who synergize well as will also help boost either armor penetration or physical attack.

Daredevils weakness can come in her lack of armor penetration, she has low armor penetration against most end-game heroes even before armor artifact boosts are active. If she is against a team with multiple armor artifact boosts then she can quickly find her damage shut down. This can be mitigated to a degree by boosting penetration with say Elmir or Fox, but Sebastian also helps by decreasing armor on the front line hero, and also adding bonus pure damage each time Daredevil crit hits. With her ramping up her physical damage with each crit hit she also pairs well with other crit heroes, and with Jet who will allow her to crit more often. A common use for DD that neglects one of her strengths (increasing heroes attacking from behind her) is within Keira crit teams, this is relying on overwhelming the enemy team with damage from DD/Keira combined with Jet/Sebastian.

When facing daredevil she can be countered by picking high armor heroes/heroes that add armor artifact boost to the team to mitigate a lot of her damage output. She deals critical hit and AOE damage so the common counters of Helios/Lian can also work well against Daredevil.
