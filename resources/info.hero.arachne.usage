Arachne is a great utility player, she can slot into most teams but is best with other mages. It's often said that Arachne is a noob trap but this is outdated guidance from before her rework. The rework served to increase Arachne's usefulness and damage output by increasing the duration of her stun and aligning her glyphs with her being a mage. Arachne has 3 primary functions:

    - Adds armor artifact boost
    - Snipes low health heroes
    - Crowd control through stun

Arachne does not hard-counter any heroes but you can consider these functions when choosing whether to use Arachne. 1) her Armor boost is useful for mitigating damage from physical damage dealers, e.g. Keira, Karkh, Ishmael; 2) Sniping low health heroes is useful against squishy damage dealers, e.g. Keira, Peppy, Lars; 3) Crowd control through stun is useful against front line damage dealers, e.g. Karkh, Ish, Jhu.

There are heroes that pair well with Arachne as they play into these functions. Faceless, Maya and Lars help group heroes together so she can stun more heroes. Lars, Faceless, and Orion add magic penetration which helps Arachne do more damage, also for this reason Arachne does well with mage teams in general when there are more magic attack boosts that help her contribute more to the team damage output. She is also a good pick with Aurora and Galahad since her presence can mitigate for their lack of armor artifact boost.

As with all heroes Arachne benefits from Nebula but there is a particular synergy between Arachne and Nebula. When Arachne teleports with Nebula's buff the buff will fall back onto Nebula. This increases Nebula's own physical attack as she is now the subject of her own buff. This means when Nebula next applies the buff to the person behind her the value of the buff is increased, approximately doubled (it scales as 100% for physical and 150% for mage, less an initial value).
