Luther is probably the most under appreciated tank in the game. Luther has the 3rd highest total defense (behind Astaroth and Markus) and the 2nd highest Armor (behind Ziri). His greatest benefit is the ability to turn your enemy team around, with stuns too. This is incredibly helpful when you want to stop AoE damage on your team or to target the rear line heroes of the enemy team. Examples include turning Keira around so the only damage is to Luther and the other 4 or safe, or turning Andvari around which makes the back heroes able to be moved or knocked up. 

As far as his damage dealing is concerned, like most tanks it's on the very low side with having the 20th best in physical damage (as of 12/6/20). Therefore, Luther has 2 skills which stun the enemy heroes, this should be used to your advantage by slowing down the rear line heroes and targeting them specifically. Also his stuns are area based, if able to group enemies together, the stun can be maximized to affect all 5 enemy heroes, and working back to front. Luther is a counter to Martha, Dorian, Peppy, and Lars to name a few; and is countered specifically by Faceless who will return Luther back into his own team stunning the other heroes. Luther is also countered by rear line high armor heroes, Thea, Lian to name a couple.
 
Luther, like all tanks absorbs a considerable amount of damage and even more when left solo in the enemies team. Because of this he needs immediate healing soon into battle. Dorian, Celeste and Markus make a great pairing as they all deliver health directly to Luther before his death. Unfortunately Martha, Thea and Maya provide health too slowly to Luther to be able to keep him alive long enough into battle.

An interesting side note/bug about Luther. When paired with Helios, Helios's sphere will move with Luther and attack all 5 heroes on the enemy team, usually when Helios ults it only causes damage to the front line however provided Luther has made the jump into the enemy group his ult will hit based on Luther's position.
